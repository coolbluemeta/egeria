/**
 * PropertyComparisonOperator is used for search requests against a metadata collection.  It defines how the properties
 * should be compared to find a matching result.
 * The property comparison operator values are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         EQ: when the property has a value that precisely equals the provided value. This is the default.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         NEQ: when the property has a value that is not equal to the provided value.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         LT: when the property has a value that is strictly less than the provided value.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         LTE: when the property has a value that is less than, or equal to, the provided value.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         GT: when the property has a value that is strictly greater than the provided value.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         GTE: when the property has a value that is greater than, or equal to, the provided value.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         IN: when the property has a value that matches at least one element of the provided list of values.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         IS_NULL: when the property has no value.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         NOT_NULL: when the property has any non-null value.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         LIKE: when the property has a value that matches the provided value.
 *     </li>
 *     <LI>
 *         NOT_LIKE: when the property has a value that does not match the provided value.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         CASE_INSENSITIVE_LIKE: when the property has a value that matches the provided value if the case is ignored.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         CASE_INSENSITIVE_NOT_LIKE: when the property has a value that does not match the provided value even if the case is ignored.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         STARTS_WITH: when the property has a value that starts with the provided value.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         ENDS_WITH: when the property has a value that ends with the provided value.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         CASE_INSENSITIVE_STARTS_WITH: when the property has a value that starts with the provided value if the case is ignored.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         CASE_INSENSITIVE_ENDS_WITH: when the property has a value that ends with the provided value if the case is ignored.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         CASE_INSENSITIVE_EQ: when the property has a value that matches the provided value if the case is ignored.
