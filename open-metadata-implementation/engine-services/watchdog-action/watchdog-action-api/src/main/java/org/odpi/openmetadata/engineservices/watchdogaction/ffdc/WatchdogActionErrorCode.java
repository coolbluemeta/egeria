/**
 * The WatchdogActionErrorCode error code is used to define first failure data capture (FFDC) for errors that
 * occur when working with the Discovery Engine Services.  It is used in conjunction with all exceptions,
 * both Checked and Runtime (unchecked).
 * The 5 fields in the enum are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>HTTP Error Code for translating between REST and JAVA - Typically the numbers used are:</li>
 *     <li><ul>
 *         <li>500 - internal error</li>
 *         <li>400 - invalid parameters</li>
 *         <li>404 - not found</li>
 *         <li>409 - data conflict errors - eg item already defined</li>
 *     </ul></li>
 *     <li>Error Message Identifier - to uniquely identify the message</li>
 *     <li>Error Message Text - includes placeholder to allow additional values to be captured</li>
 *     <li>SystemAction - describes the result of the error</li>
 *     <li>UserAction - describes how a user should correct the error</li>
 * </ul>
