# Integration Connectors

The integration connectors are responsible for exchanging metadata with third
party technologies through the [Open Integration Framework (OIF)](../../../frameworks/open-integration-framework).
They run in the [Integration Daemon](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/integration-daemon)
OMAG Server.

Details of Egeria's integration connectors are found in the
[Connector Catalog](https://egeria-project.org/connectors/#integration-connectors)
