# Open Metadata Security Access Connectors

The connector in this module provides a combined implementation of the [open metadata security connectors](https://egeria-project.org/features/metadata-security/overview/)
that can be added to the OMAG Server Platform and to any OMAG server
running on the platform.  The connector makes use of externalized security information
supplied by an embedded [Secrets Store Connector](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/secrets-store-connector/).

There is a sample YAML-based secrets store called `coco-user-directory.omsecrets` included in Egeria's 
[deployment](../../../../../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-deployment/secrets).
With this sample secrets store, it is possible to experiment with the use of 
[governance zones](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/governance-zone)
to control the visibility of elements
through the open metadata services as well as more standard authorization services base around the platform/server/service called.

The open metadata platform security connector provides authorization
services for the platform services and the admin service to create a new server.
The open metadata server security connector is specific to an OMAG server instance and
is defined in the configuration document for a server.

This connector illustrates how a security connector implementation extends the appropriate base class from 
[metadata-security](../../../../common-services/metadata-security) and uses their methods to provide
a security service.

Features of this implementation are described below.

## User security

The user security methods pass through all user account management and verification to the nested secrets store connector.
The other security methods validate that that calling user has a valid user account before performing any specific checks.

## Governance Zones

Governance zones are supported through the element security methods.
Each governance zone is modelled as a security access control.
The zone itself represents a collection of metadata.
The security access control defines which users can perform which operation.
There is a DEFAULT operation that means, all operations not explicitly defined.


## Connection security

Finally, the connector will only permit a connector with 
to access Connection object that have security information in it such as userIds and passwords.
